I'm a passionate web developer who finds great satisfaction in crafting websites. Right now, I'm in the process of completing a Udemy course to become a proficient frontend developer. My strengths include critical thinking, curiosity, creativity, and attention to detail. I'm interested in working as part of a team on larger and more complex projects.

At present, the project I am most proud of is the website for a charitable organization, which I completed on a pro bono basis (skills volunteering). Thanks to this project, I was able to enhance my existing skills and learn a lot of new ones. Clients were also satisfied with my work because they received an effective fundraising tool with an integrated payment system.

*HTML/Pug, CSS/SCSS, JS, Gulp*

As part of the project, I was responsible for developing the frontend of several pages of a website, which later evolved into an online store.

The project required me to implement an adaptive design and menu to ensure an optimal appearance and user-friendly navigation on various devices. I performed testing of the website on different devices and web browsers, as well as optimized images for various screen resolutions.

During the project, I collaborated effectively with clients and the designer to understand their needs and expectations regarding web development.

I voluntarily completed this project on a pro bono basis. Charitable organization website with the ability to send donations, subscribe to e-mail newsletters, fill out an application for a partnership.
This is my first project built from scratch. At the beginning of the project, I was competent in HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript skills, which allowed me to develop essential elements like mobile menus.

Throughout the project, I was faced with new challenges, including creating a customer contact form that would send data to the site manager via email, sending AJAX requests to third-party APIs, developing a donation form integrated with payment system (LiqPay), making the website bilingual, formatting previews for links on social media pages, and optimizing image sizes.

In order to simplify the development process, I used tools like Gulp and SCSS.

The developed website proved to be an effective fundraising tool for the organization, playing a big role in boosting their fundraising campaigns.

A year later, I received a request to improve the project. This time, I collaborated with a designer and a backend developer who migrated the website to a CMS. We introduced a 'Fundraising' section to facilitate fundraising for specific charitable campaigns.

The website consists of two parts. An external section that lists the service's advantages and an internal aggregator of requests on major crypto exchanges with various display modes. Initially, it was built using Bootstrap but lacked responsiveness. My task was to adapt the website for various device screen sizes and fix some issues from the previous development.
